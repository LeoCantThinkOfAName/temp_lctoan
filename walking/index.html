                <p>
                    Hi,<br>
                    This is just a temporary site, so I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible,<br>
                    but I guess most of people won't appreciate this...<br>
                    And The tiny man walks like a robot...<br>
                    Hmmm... I guess github page is not an idea place to do this trick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway...
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see, here's no fancy animation and all the RWD effect like other portfolios do.<br>
                    There's quite some people use CSS framework to present their works.<br>
                    Obviously I'm not.<br>
                    I'd more like to use skeleton to gain a basic grip than use bootstrap things.<br>
                    Althought I'm not a UI designer apparently.<br> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not going to put a bunch of progress-bar-like things to convince you that<br>
                    "I've mastered HTML, 80 percent familiar with JavaScript" etc...<br>
                    Because there's so many HTML markup that I'm pretty sure I never use,<br>
                    and probably, not gonna use...<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And talking about JavaScript?&nbsp;What does 80 percent means?<br>
                    Like "I know 80 percent of all the built-in method"?<br> 
                    Or "I'm the upper 20 among all the people who learns JavaScript"?<br>
                    It's so confusing...<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other things like JQuery(Like this is really matters) or Googling ability...<br>
                    That do draws my attention.<br>
                    I would really like to know how to scale "Googling ability".<br>
                    In my imagination there's a huge Googling contest or something...<br>
                    And people trying to be the first one who find out the answer on Google...<br>
                    That would be fun!(JK)<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doesn't mean showing what technique I'm more familiar is wrong.<br>
                    But I think it only makes sense if I could distribute 100 percent on each technique,<br>
                    instead of scoring all of them from 0 to 100.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And most of all...<br>
                    The progress-bar things are just parallax effect.<br>
                    Even comes from the very same CSS framework they are using...<br>
                    It's boring...<br>
                    Yes, it's fast to build and looks cool...<br>
                    But I don't care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alright, I'm gonna stop bitching about it now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you linked here via my resume.<br>
                    You probably knew that I'm self taught.(of course not, it's all from books and online courses or communities)<br>
                    I learned from scratch, and refuse to use all the frameworks and liberaries just to torturing myself.<br>
                    As a noob in computer science, I've been through a lot of struggles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there's a advantage to start learning without all the libraries,<br>
                    I can much easier to adapt different libraries in ease by reading their documents.<br>
                    We gotta learn to walk before we can jump, huh?
                </p>
                <p>
                    So after the new born chicken period, I start to use JQuery to make things a lil bit faseter.<br>
                    And also AngularJS(1.X) for building some simple applications.<br>
                    (probably gonna learn some react.JS, angular in my case is somewhat overkill)<br>
                    And am going to learn more and more new stuffs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm more confident than ever, and open for all the challenges!<br>
                    (maybe not. I just play it cool.)<br>
                    Tell me if you like it, or hate it, or probably you may think I'm retarded...<br>
                    It's all totally resonable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cheers, Leo.
